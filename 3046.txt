            "Good Location and view"/n
The location of the hotel is such that you can enjoy your cup of hot tea overlooking the Nilgiri hills. The rooms are quit good with good furniture. Getting hot water will take time as you need to keep the tap open for a while till you start getting hot water.
They have a cable trolley system to carry the passengers up and down as the cottages are built on a steep slope. Its a short fun ride. Food is good. One advise would be to get the rooms on the top side and avoid the last ones on the bottom. The rooms on the top were much better in terms of furniture, TV, bathroom.

            "Sagar Holiday Resorts look over the valley which l..."/n

                    Sagar Holiday Resorts look over the valley which leads to Conoor. All the rooms open to endless clouds and greenery and a superb view of life downhill. The room have a huge balcony and comes with all the frills that you expect from a Hotel- blankets, room service, travel kits. The food is excellent - bot vegetarian and non vegetarian and they are available with no inappropriate delays. We had buffet breakfast and the spread was very satisfactory. The location of the resort is the most exciting part of staying there. You can be at your room and chill out endlessly. We went on a trek on the Conoor rail track and that was the best part of our holiday.

            "Lovely stay at a lovely place"/n

                    Wow I would just love to go this place again. The hotel location was amazing giving a valley view to each room with a private balcony. Delicious food and a location very near from the city just 3 kms having availability of public transport as well as private vehicle can be arranged by hotel. Ooty was a awesome trip with freezing weather and this resort was an icing on the cake. Absolutely value for money loved it.

            "We travel for 3 days to Ooty and stayed in the sag..."/n

                    We travel for 3 days to Ooty and stayed in the sagar Hotel. We travel from chennai to Ooty by car. The car parking facilities and hotel facilities are enough for us to stay there in the hotel. The sight seeing from the hotel is very less distance. The admosphere and peoples in Ooty are good. Lot of vegitables and vegeterian food are excellant. The world heritage Train travel with sight seeing is enjoyable for my family. Totally the trip is very very usefull and we never forget it in our life.

            "Service can improve"/n

                    Overall experience was good with regards to Location and the way resort is constructed, it looks beautiful. The destination in itself is beautiful and appearance is well thought and designed. The resort indeed looks like a big heart, wish the service was inline and synchronized to support my comments.

            "On a good location and has excellent view"/n

                    The Resort is on a good location, and has excellent view and away from the market. 
The rooms are sufficiently large with living, balcony and comfortable. The furniture and fixtures are clean and neat. The supplies in the room are enough to stay comfortably. Other amenities like TV, water heater etc were in working conditions.

The reception area is open and staff were receptive. One of the Sr Management is always available in the hotel to take care of any eventualities. 

Staff are co-operative and well behaved. The restaurant is clean and food was excellent but found little expensive in terms of quantity offered in the dish. There is no buffet system and you have to order as per menu.

Room service is good. Recreation facilities in house like carom other indoor games were provided.

I do recommend families to use this Resort at the reasonable price.
