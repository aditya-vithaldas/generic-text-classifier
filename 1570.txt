            "Had an excellent stay at Willow hill"/n

                    We booked for Garden room for two days. As promised in pictures the room was more beautiful than it appeared and the private garden attached with the room was like icing on the cake. We had a very comfortable stay in the hotel. Location was excellent, away from main market area, very peaceful and calm. We had little trouble with hot water first day but it was manageable.

The only drawback of hotel was restaurant service. The food was good but the service was not up to mark, Day 1 we waited for almost an hour for breakfast, even the complimentary breakfast was limited -either take continental (bread toast omelet) or Indian ( idli dosa) breakfast. Day 2 we informed half an hour back for breakfast so we got our breakfast on time.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to couples or groups who want calm and peaceful stay with excellent amenities. The hotel staff was very polite and helpful. My suggestion to hotel is that they can include -bonfire in their service, location weather and bonfire will be dazzling combo. To the staff- Keep up the good work. Cheers!

            "Stay in Willow Hill"/n

                    The trip was weekend getaway for me and my friends from Chennai. The hotel had helped us out in for a early check-in ( one hour before the actual time). Once you step inside the room you can feel the wooden finish texture of the room. The rooms are generally very dimly light, which was a drawback. But the amenities provided was good like Bath tube and park etc. On the other hand they had failed to provide a room heater even in superior room in cold climate region. Also, the hotel is located very far away from the city which might interest some and could irritate others like me. People planning to stay in this hotel better have rented bikes or cars so that they won lose their time much in reaching the hotel. The people who are attracted by spooky places will have fun time here, scaring your friends who are not as courage's as your. The one thing really good here was the hot Bath tube provided big enough for you to relaxing Bath after the fun filled trip around Ooty and connor. Connor is must visit for all the people, we felt that Connor is better place to roam around and enjoy in the cold climate than in Ooty. The hilly mountains and cloudy sky adds to the beauty of the place. While staying in the hotel people should bring their own shampoo, tooth brush, tooth paste and mouth wash, as are provided by the hotel. Even we are just provided with one shower cap, when two people are staying together. Overall though the hotel look spooky its a comfortable stay and the food provided in the hotel is also manageable. So, I will definitely ask to give it a try if have or plan to take vehicles to travel around Ooty.

            "Great stay with well furnished room "/n

                    It was a great time at the hotel. We requested for an early check-in, it was approved, we request for a late check-out, it was approved also, even on a off season time, some hotel would not have approved it. The reception personnel were very helpful in advise on what to do in the city. The room was so good, well furnished, cool light settings great view from the restaurant and a good location. Breakfast was good, with fresh fruits juice, fried eggs, sliced bread and everything you would want for breakfast. So I would love to spent some more days in the future at the same.
