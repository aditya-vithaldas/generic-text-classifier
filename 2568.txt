            "Just an awesome experience "/n

                    We went to Hotel Gem Park, Ooty with our family and I can say that it is one of the best hotels out there!!!

The rooms are spacious and well maintained. Just gives you a nice, luxurious feel.

Talking about the food, it really suits various people backgrounds. That is the variety of food which I experienced there and it was just fabulous!!

The hotel offers free WiFi so you can browse the net or do your job at the comfort of your room at no extra charges.

There is a swimming pool which is heated one and it felt good lying in the hot water at that COLD region. You have to experience that.

The main thing about this hotel is the location at which it's positioned - truly EXOTIC one indeed. The view from this hotel almost covers the entire city and is a sight for the eyes.

Moreover the hotel has a really good, clean atmosphere and is really well maintained with a variety of flowers and such. You can take a variety of photos inside the hotel itself!!

Room service is quick and you can find a sense of hospitality out there.

            "An ideal retreat for a relaxed family holiday"/n

                    Gem Park Hotel was an ideal retreat for a relaxed luxurious family holiday and made our stay at Ooty a memorable experience.

Rooms were a delight as they were spacious. We were two families with children. The queen sized beds in the room were comfortable for two adults and two children under 12. The best floor's to stay on are the 6th and 7th floor. We spent 4 nights at the Hotel by the end of which we felt totally at home there. The hotel is tucked away from the hustle bustle of the city and yet is very accessible to all the major junctions. The breathtaking view, beautifully laid out lawns with a variety of flowers and the fireplace inside made for a charming ambiance! 

The Hotel staff was warm and hospitable. Minor issues relating to the washrooms were taken care of immediately. Our package with them included breakfast plus either lunch /dinner. We were impressed by the hospitality extended to us by the staff at the Toda cafe who went out of their way to provide us with something special each day. In the evenings the cafe had live music, good lighting and a warm atmosphere.One can also eat at the Chinese restaurant at the hotel. 

After spending the day sightseeing one can come back to relax at the Hotel in the evening. Children and adults can spend a lovely time with the lineup of evening activities organized by the hotel like the magic show, bonfire, video game parlor, recreational facilities, and kids play area, disco with DJ etc. An innovative indoor swimming pool is a definite plus point as despite the cool weather it's actually possible to swim in Ooty!  The pool is heated over the weekends. The hotel also has a beauty parlor and spa facility. 

Gem Park is everything that one can hope for from a great property.

            "It has been a great experience staying in Holiday..."/n

                    It has been a great experience staying in Holiday Inn Gem Park in Ooty. The location of the hotel is awesome. From the room window, I really enjoyed the view of the dark hills and mixture of clouds and mist. Spacious hotel rooms with all facilities, excellent room service, mouth watering food -from continental to north indian to south indian, sightseeing service - everything made our stay thoroughly enjoyable. Over all these things, I must say, the hospitality, the warmth in service (travel desk and canteen stuffs) and friendliness of all the hotel stuffs was the pick of my satisfaction. I will visit the Gem Park everytime I go to Ooty. Thanks to all you guyz to make our stay so comfortable, enjoyable and memorable.

            "We stayed at this hotel during our Christmas vacat..."/n

                    We stayed at this hotel during our Christmas vacation. The hotel is located on a hill with clear beautiful view of the Ooty town, the misty blue mountains all around , the lush green trees and tea estates. Every room had this beautiful view and we enjoyed the views along with the winter chill and misty atmosphere. The food spread at breakfast and dinner was very good and tasty. The service was quick, efficient and prompt. The dining room too had large open glass front with the view of the misty mountains.There was a covered swimming pool and play equipment for children. Flowered gardens added to the overall view.
