away from main market area; very peaceful and calm,location We had little trouble with hot water first day but it was manageable,facilityThe only drawback of hotel was restaurant service,service The food was good but the service was not up to mark; Day 1 we waited for almost an hour for breakfast; even the complimentary breakfast was limited -either take continental (bread toast omelet) or Indian ( idli dosa) breakfast,food Day 2 we informed half an hour back for breakfast so we got our breakfast on time,foodI would definitely recommend this hotel to couples or groups who want calm and peaceful stay with excellent amenities,activity The hotel staff was very polite and helpful,staff My suggestion to hotel is that they can include -bonfire in their service; location weather and bonfire will be dazzling combo,activity To the staff- Keep up the good work,staffComfortable hotel in Ooty with excellent services,service The hotel had helped us out in for a early check-in ( one hour before the actual time),checkin Once you step inside the room you can feel the wooden finish texture of the room,room The rooms are generally very dimly light; which was a drawback,room But the amenities provided was good like Bath tube and park etc,facility On the other hand they had failed to provide a room heater even in superior room in cold climate region,room Also; the hotel is located very far away from the city which might interest some and could irritate others like me,location People planning to stay in this hotel better have rented bikes or cars so that they won lose their time much in reaching the hotel,location The one thing really good here was the hot Bath tube provided big enough for you to relaxing Bath after the fun filled trip around Ooty and connor,room Connor is must visit for all the people; we felt that Connor is better place to roam around and enjoy in the cold climate than in Ooty,location The hilly mountains and cloudy sky adds to the beauty of the place,location While staying in the hotel people should bring their own shampoo; tooth brush; tooth paste and mouth wash; as are provided by the hotel,facilityEven we are just provided with one shower cap; when two people are staying together,facilityOverall though the hotel look spooky its a comfortable stay and the food provided in the hotel is also manageable,foodSo;
