            "My rating is for the Club Mahindra Derby Green, Oo..."/n

                    My rating is for the Club Mahindra Derby Green, Ooty. Its an awesome place. We are fans of the Club Mahindra properties and we never are let down, be it the location, amenities, food, services, or leisure activities at the resort. And, this was nothing less. The resort overlooks the lush-green race course. The restaurant menu is very widespread, giving you lot of options. Be sure to put on a couple of kilos when you reach back. The rooms are spacious, clean, and well maintained too, true to the Mahindra standards.

            "Good food"/n

                    I visited Ooty with my family & friends after a long time.We stayed at the Club Mahindra-Derby Green Property, which is a heritage property.This property overlooks the Race Course. It is well located, close to Charing Cross and the Bus-Stand. Very convenient. Some of the rooms are very good with great views.  

Food was good. The South Indian cuisines were excellent. Idlies were the softest I ever ate. You have plenty of choice. South Indian, North Indian, Continental and  Chinese.

                    I experienced cold bliss in the month of May. Amazing weather, rainfall almost every night, cloud cover through the day made me feel I was far from Indian summer. Great room, good food & a loving wife made this a memorable trip.

            "Heritage villa converted into a hotel"/n

                    If you like staying in bungalow which has some heritage value / rich past to it, then you will love this place. This villa once owned by the Danish Motor Company is located a few miles away from the city center. Would suggest travelers to get their own transport. The rooms are superbly designed and very spacious. The interiors in the rooms are simple yet very well designed, especially the ones in the upper floors. There are very few activities to do compared to the derby green of the same group located a few miles away. Food served was good. Good place to visit with your family.
