            "Old world charm and magnificent location"/n
Situated on top of a hillock overlooking tea gardens, Hotel Highland offers a fabulous panoramic view. I visited Ooty with my family and it being my 3rd visit to the hill station, we chose a place a little away from the hustle and bustle of the center of the town. We stayed for 2 days and would definitely recommend this hotel for those who love quietness and would like to stay in the midst of nature.

I had booked the hotel through booking after going through the reviews. The hotel is located near Doddabetta peak, about 15 min drive from Ooty bus station. We took the overnight sleeper coach from Bangalore and reached Ooty around 7:15am. The hotel had arranged for a pick up from the bus stop (you have to tell them earlier) for Rs 300.

The front desk was helpful and got me the room ready even though the normal check in is at 12 noon. The room was quite good with the usual amenities and whatever was promised in the website. The bathroom drain was not working and the housekeeping was prompt in fixing the same.

The hotel grounds are good and at different levels. They have a nice play area (with slides, swings, merry go round, trampoline). There is a nice play room with a cosy library, TT, carom, chess, foosball, video games etc. My daughter (11 yrs) had a gala time. The hotel also organizes events like story writing, karaoke, bon fire etc to engage the guests.

The breakfast is included in the room tariff and has a good spread.

Our room was in the 2nd floor. I would recommend 1st or 2nd floor as you get some views. But be mindful as the hotel does not have lifts.

The travel desk had organized tours to Kunnor and Ooty lake as well as my drop to Mysore. On the way I had also visited the Mudumalai Reserve Forest. The forest has safaris with vans (minimum 20 heads needed and costs 135/head) or there are private jeeps (cost 1000) for 1 hr of safari. You can see deer, langurs, bisons, peacocks, crocodiles and if you are lucky then elephants, tigers as well.

            "Excellent service & best place for relaxation"/n
I am flattened by their service and how they treat their guest. The staff, room service and the restaurant management are all very good and helpful. The room service and the hotel staff are excellent. They were very considerate right from the time we checked-in till our check-out. They were never late for any orders placed from our room. Their garden is the best place for your relaxation. It will remove all your worries and will provide a bliss. Cheers to the hotel management. I loved the hotel, I would definitely come back to this hotel when I will visit back.

            "Awesome view & served delicious food "/n
I stayed in this hotel for 4 days. The hotel has a very huge lawn and huge rooms. The view from the room was amazing. But being a north Indian one can not eat food of south India. But this hotel serves very delicious food which was just awesome It was one of the overwhelming experience.

            "Excellent place to stay in Ooty"/n
Location of hotel is excellent, little far from city. One Doddabetta peak. Perfect place to stay for those who love nature and away from hustle of city. Service is excellent. They should have more resort activities. Food is good. Doddabetta peak is just 3 km from hotel. Children activities are really good. Can plan for 3 to 4 nights in Ooty. Nearest airport is Coimbatore. Ooty is 90 km from Coimbatore, takes about two and half hour from Coimbatore. Not very costly. Surrounded by lush green area and Valley.

Overall hotel is good with good view and value for money. One can select this hotel who really want to stay away from city crowd. Pykara lake and Pykara waterfall is a must visit place, one must do boating in Pykara lake, it's an amazing experience. MudumalaI wildlife sanctuary is near to Ooty. You can plan one day trip for that. Ooty is really good for nature lovers. You feel as if you are in the lap of nature. Overall, ooty is a must visit place in India. You ask for Valley view room in this hotel.

            "Wonderful location and good view from hotel"/n

                    I had been to this hotel with my friends in the month of April 2015 and stayed in this hotel for 4 days. The hotel looked really beautiful with it's view and also the interior of the hotel was superb. The rooms were very clean and maintained with decorative night lamps in such a beautiful environment. The rooms were big and spacious, the attached washrooms were also clean and there was a TV in the room along with the WiFi connectivity. There was no need of AC or fan as the temperature there is too cool and awesome. The staff of the hotel were too co-operative and also friendly so we didn't face any problem in getting any services and they even helped us to guide the beautiful places to visit.

The hotel served very hot food and the food was yummy, it was all with a affordable price. There was a small stall of panipuri just nearer to hotel. The area where the hotel was also very peaceful. So whoever visits this place can have the experience of this hotel as it comes with an affordable amount.

            "Staying here was very much comfortable"/n

                    The location of the hotel was nice. It's conveniently located. The behaviour of the staff was OK. The hotels exteriors looked very good, but it was OK from inside. The room was clean and well maintained. It has a hill view. AC and TV in the room were functioning properly. Food quality was good. The check in and check out was done without any delay. The was no swimming pool or gym at the hotel. The hotel has not arranged vehicles for sightseeing. The stay there was value for money and I would like to recommend this hotel to other tourists. My suggestion is they can improve their food variety specially for the children.

            "Perfect weekend getaway; good activities"/n

                    I booked this place in Ooty for a weekend getaway from Bangalore with my parents. A lil further from Ooty, it is located near the Doddabetta peak and Tea Museum. This place manages to charm with the solace and escape it provides from the commercialized streets of Ooty. The hotel lacks a pool, although you wouldn't want one in the freezing Ooty temperature. The rooms are pretty much perfect for a weekend getaway. They provide a whole catalogue of activities, including a batting pitch with machine bowlers, camp fire, xbox and various other games. Great wifi in case you wanna catch up on some urgent work. Use maps to find this place, with the destination as Doddabetta Junction. They need to update the location details on Google Maps which shows the Hotel somewhere in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The only grievance I carried was the quality and taste of food as it wasn't up to the mark even though the spread was nice. Food tasted horrible, starting from their welcome drink to the dessert. Overall, a great experience, would love to visit again if they hire new chefs.

            "Decent hotel to stay and has awesome valley view "/n

                    Ooty is known for its scenic beauty and if you are looking to enjoy the same thoroughly, Highland is the place. Located on the hill side of Doddabetta, the resort offers a fantastic valley view from the top. While the hotel is not a noted star property, it is decent one with good rooms, food and outdoor activities.

Since we were a group visiting the place, the check-in is done at a group level. They have a restaurant in the ground level which offers well spread breakfast. The rooms are cosy with basic facilities like LCD TV, showers, tea kettle etc., A set of rooms on valley side offer good view. The buffet lunch at the restaurant is good. The hotel has a small ground on its left which can be used for outdoor activities like campfire which can be arranged by the hotel. This place offers awesome view of valley which can add to your party.
