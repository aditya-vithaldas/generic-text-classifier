            "Good place to stay but don;t expect pool!"/n

                    Nothing better to be with your family, but being with then a exotic place like ooty is an added experience.

The hill station with bollywood history, we had three day travel plan to this place, later realised that this place cannot be enjoyed in this little span of time, there are beautiful alleys with stretched arms inviting you, the birds around singing for you, beautiful lakes and sports as well as a part of them. 

 We had blocked our stay with Welback group of hotels, which is little far from the market but we found it as a very good place stay.

 We had little service delay at that time of visit as there was a theft happened at the hotel and they had lost some cash, due to police enquiry and the forensic survey all the staff were engaged in there, otherwise all of them were well placed and kind.

As being a car lover, was flattered with the collection of the owners Austin Martin 1921 in a running condition, believe me it is a very difficult task to maintain such vehicles in a fully functional condition.

Those who are expecting pool and play area then this would not be the right place as this hotel has none of them, as the weather here being so chilled i don\'t think any one would dare to dip in a pool, until its a temperature controlled.

As i have mentioned earlier, being in ooty is pleasure ad do visit with enough time as in you need to plan it in such a way that, one site visit per day, spend time there and feel the place, bet you that you will fall in love with the place.

Those who have not visited tea terrace, this is the safe and best place with plenty of tea terrace farming, its a different kind of experience, which every one should have a hands on.

  Overall experience was excellent both with the Hotel and the place.

  Adding few moments captured.

            "A perfect hotel to stay with good facilities and food  "/n

                    The hotel was conveniently located and it was close to railway station. The check-in and check-out process was done on time. There were all required shops and hospital in the surroundings of the hotel. The interior and exterior of the hotel was good. The behaviour of the staff in the hotel was helpful and friendly, and they were quick in service. The room allotted to me was spacious, neat and clean, and they provided all required amenities at working condition and there was city view. They use clean the rooms on regular basis. They provided both veg and non-veg food in the hotel and it was good in quality, quantity and reasonable. There were no pool in the hotel and it is not required for the place too. They organise nice activities and it was and also they arrange for camp-fire but I dint utilise it. I liked the stay in this hotel, as they were perfect at everything. The hotel was very much worthy and I definitely recommend to other travellers.

            "Rooms are good and spacious"/n

                    Rooms are good and spacious, interior and furniture are upto mark. Even the meals have proper preparation and service is satisfactory. Easy to access. Suggested for groups also. Restaurant size should increase to accommodate more guest.

            "Well behaved staffs but not upto the mark"/n

                    Ours was a purely family outing with wife and the trip was basically intended to see  southern part of the mother land and bask in the pleasant environs of Ooty and surrounding areas. The tour operator had promised us a three star stay at welbeck with dinner and breakfast complimentary. We were full of enthusiasm and keenness to enjoy this one and perhaps last occasion for us as we both husband and wife are above 70.

To our dismay nothing of the was in store for us at the Welbeck as we found the place far below our expectations in most respects.
Except for the reception and entrance where staff was most well behaved and courteous rest of the services were purely routine. Surroundings of the property, with a dingy wine store cum bar facing our room window, size of room and fixtures were just routine. Most disturbing for us were moments we spent in the restaurant when we were asked to sign a slip of around 2100 on the plea that they have a ceiling of rs 500 per head  which was never mentioned either orally or in the sponsor letter handed over to us by the tour operator agency. This spoiled our mood as we felt cheated or befooled. We raised the issue with the manager and even our agent at jalandhar and with great effort it got resolved almost at the time of our check out. Hotel was reluctant to serve food at the room and we aged couple were forced to come down to a very small restaurant every time.

My only advise to travellers is to make sure that their agents or the hotels provide the promised services or else be made to compensate the tourists.

We would certainly like not to stay at Welbeck if ever we go back to Ooty.  not would we recommend any fellow tourist to opt for Welbeck.  There are many more hotels in Ooty with far better facilities and even if a bit costlier, one would [prefer a proper three star property for a cosy and pleasant stay.

            "Nice Hotel with awesome service"/n

                    I am recently married and my friends presented me with the honeymoon package to Ooty and they book the room in well back residency. 

It's an wonderful experience in that hotel. Nice place nice surrounding, very good food and awesome service. Tourist spots around Ooty are little far from the hotel and it's good because we have to see lot of things on the way to some of the tourist spots. 

For the recently married couples it is the Best place to celebrate your honeymoon.
