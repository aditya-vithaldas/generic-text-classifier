The stay was good, in this Resort. No difficulties to find the resort. Trip was with my family in the month of May 2015. No delay in check in and check out process. I ate food in the resort was good in quality. Room allotted to me was spacious, clean and amenities were in working condition. No activities were conducted in the resort. The stay was value for money.

            "Good place to stay"/n
Visited the place with wife to celebrate anniversary. First off you should know that road to reach the place is little scary, its a muddy road with stiff slope so fasten seat belts and have a good car. The bumpy stretch is not long may be 300 mt or so but we went when it was raining and it was worrisome. Hotel staff was good, location nice with good view with a gallery to room for relaxing. Rooms were nice and great thing was hot water available round the clock which is immense pleasure when weather gets really cold. Try the route to Doddabeta peak and leave road just before tea garden to reach hotel most comfortably ( except last treacherous stretch! ). Room interior was good with reasonable television connection but don't expect TATA Sky. One thing needed improvement was food which was just about average especially to north indian tourists. So better plan meals outside but dinner time one will be worried driving back in dark near hotel.

            "Staff's behaviour was very good"/n
It was my honeymoon trip to the hotel. The appearance of the hotel was very good. The room facility was good at the hotel. The hotel had not provided the activities. Wi-Fi connection was not provided in the hotel. The hotel had provided the parking facility. The amenities in the room were provided and all were functioning properly. The hotel had served many varieties in food. The staffâ€™s behaviour was very good. The hotel was located at the hill top. The garden of the hotel was also good. It was a perfect place for honeymoon.

            "Interior look of room was good"/n
I had visited the resort with my family. The food and drink provided by the resort was good in taste. The activities were not provided in the resort. The complementary breakfast was provided by the resort. The resort was located near to the city. The interior look of the room was very good. I would recommend the resort for other travellers. The staff's behaviour and response were very good. The resort was affordable for middle class visitors.

            "Living amongst the clouds"/n
Stay: 3rd Dec 2015 and 4th Dec 2015.

Review:

Value for Money: Booked a 2 + 1 Room at 2, 500/- from makemytrip which was okay. The room [105] was on the stilt/first floor of the building. You don't require the AC as it gets pretty chilly in the hills. The room manages to keep the cold out.

Service quality: Good. The hotel staff sends out a Mahindra Scorpio to fetch you at the entrance of the Dodabetta Tea Factory. A few minutes from the entrance the path steeps into a narrow one lane mountain path leading to the resort which adds a touch of adventure to the trip.

Food and Drink: Being located in the hills the there are limited options when it comes to food (we inquired with the local Domino's whether they deliver, they were a bit hesitant). The hotel has a restaurant area. The food is served hot with a fixed menu. The food is pretty filling.

Location: The touring sights are close-by i. e. Within a radius of 10-12 km from the hotel. Being amongst the hills there are many photo-ops for selfie enthusiasts. The Dodabetta peak and Tea factory are a hop skip jump away (be a cardio enthusiast if you are into trekking).

Amenities: There is Wi-Fi connection is available only in the reception area and with the night time temperatures being as low as 10 degrees you wouldn't want to venture to the reception for Wi-Fi. AC isn't required as it is pretty chilly during night. Every room has a geyser in the bathroom so 24x7 hot water.

Cleanliness: The rooms are kept clean, fresh or extra towels are replaced/kept as and when you call the reception.

            "Excellent view from the hotel and good stay"/n

                    The hotel has a great ambiance and surroundings. The way to reach the hotel is not good and is around 1.5 km from the main road. The staff is good with good room service but the food quality is not that good one can expect from the hotel. The view from room is just spectacular and has wide windows. The rooms are spacious and clean. The bathroom is also big enough and has all facilities like hot water. 

The stay was just excellent and great. The appearance of the hotel is also appealing. I would recommend a stay at this hotel for sure. Though not very high on facilities but a good option to consider. The location is special and it gives immense pleasure to see the mountains from the room and outside the hotel.

            "Nice location - isolated place, good for stay "/n

                    We visited as family in the month of Aug 2015 for single day stay, we travelled from Coimbatore.

Location : the place is situated downside road from tea factory and museum on Kotagiri road. From tea factory u will be picked up by Bolero jeep to the property ( about 1 km) - it's a mud road difficult for routine car drive.

The rooms and building is in a nice picturesque location with enface view of Small town with tiny houses and on the right side view of rooty hills. Its isolated disconnected to the town but very near to the town by distance ( < 4 to 5 km).

Rooms and amenities :
Rooms are spacious and well maintained. Beddings are clean, bathrooms are tidy. Balcony is there to sit and view the outside garden. Room service is good and decent but they will be little bit late if more guests are there in property, otherwise they are responsive and do needful. Power plug sockets are average and needs more maintenance - bit uncomfortable if you are too techy with many electronic gadgets. Good thing is that Geyser is available for all rooms u can use it as per your need.

Located within the property, room service available but you have to order soon- Service will be delayed as they take more time for preparation. They take exclusive orders and start preparing only for the orders so it will be the prevailing situation. Little bit more costly but quality and quantity are good.

Complimentary breakfast in restaurant will be average but good, not too many items. People checking in afternoon or late night can have food in on-the way veg hotel ( Aryaas) 2 kms from the hotel. Since after checking in you cannot move to town immediately as you need jeep travel to the car parking and then move to town.

Reception : They are well informed and coordinated - attend and respond to our phone calls for search of destination. Checking in and check-out are smooth.

Amenities : one small garden and park side resting benches are provided, no other special amenities. Major sightseeing points are within 4 to 7 kms distance.

            "Peaceful stay away from city huss buss"/n

                    I had been to this place to relax and spent quality time with family. That's why opted for this as this is a perfect place if you want to stay away from city chaos.

This is on the slopes of Doddabetta hill top -just below the tea factory and has a nice view of city specially in night.

Rooms are well-maintained as well neat and clean. Front desk is helpful and they do arrange all sightseeing for you if you are unaware of this place or new to Ooty. They do arrange pick and drop to bus stops as well if requested.

Restaurant at the hotel was good and food was quite tasty I really liked it. Moreover the breakfasts were complimentary which was just awesome. As its far from city you won't have another option and will have to eat here only. But that option was also not bad as per my opinion.
