            "Excellent experience with excellent facilities and services"/n

                    A year back in the month of April I had resided at Meadows Residency for four days and an excellent experience. The hotel was located in the heart of the city and nearby airport with good environment. The staff and services at this hotel were quick to attain and friendly. The check-in and check-out process was done on time. This hotel was well-maintained and new with good interior-interior appearance. The room allotted to me was neat and clean with good amenities. The food that I had ordered at this restaurant of this hotel was good to eat. There was a sightseeing trip organised by the hotel, which was good. The amount that I had spent at this hotel was good and worthy so I would recommend this hotel to other travellers.

            "We found Meadows Residency to be a clean, spanking..."/n

                    We found Meadows Residency to be a clean, spanking new property with nice rooms and friendly service levels. Just ahead of Charing Cross on the Coonoor Road itself, the hotel was easy to find and is only a short drive to the Railway station and Botanical garden.

The washroom hygiene is good, something which I am particular about. The restaurant has good, delicious dishes & the service is excellent & gracious. The front desk is the cherry on the topping, good job fellas.
