two days	room As promised in pictures the room was more beautiful than it appeared and the private garden attached with the room was like icing on the cake	room We had a very comfortable stay in the hotel	hotel Location was excellent; away from main market area; very peaceful and calm	location We had little trouble with hot water first day but it was manageable	facilityThe only drawback of hotel was restaurant service	service The food was good but the service was not up to mark; Day 1 we waited for almost an hour for breakfast; even the complimentary breakfast was limited -either take continental (bread toast omelet) or Indian ( idli dosa) breakfast	food Day 2 we informed half an hour back for breakfast so we got our breakfast on time	foodI would definitely recommend this hotel to couples or groups who want calm and peaceful stay with excellent amenities	activity The hotel staff was very polite and helpful	staff My suggestion to hotel is that they can include -bonfire in their service; location weather and bonfire will be dazzling combo	activities To the staff- Keep up the good work	staff Cheers!	hotelComfortable hotel in Ooty with excellent services	serviceWillow Hill hotel was superb; this is one of the excellent hotel in Ooty	hotel We enjoyed a lot in this hotel and really satisfied with its excellence	hotel It's completely very good for tourists for leaving in Willow Hill hotel	hotel Overall; it is a very comfortable hotel in Ooty; no comments from that hotel from out side	hotel It's really nice and beautiful hotel in Ooty	hotelStay in Willow Hill	hotelThe trip was weekend getaway for me and my friends from Chennai	hotel The hotel had helped us out in for a early check-in ( one hour before the actual time)	checkin Once you step inside the room you can feel the wooden finish texture of the room	room The rooms are generally very dimly light; which was a drawback	room But the amenities provided was good like Bath tube and park etc	facility On the other hand they had failed to provide a room heater even in superior room in cold climate region	room Also; the hotel is located very far away from the city which might interest some and could irritate others like me	location People planning to stay in this hotel better have rented bikes or cars so that they won lose their time much in reaching the hotel	location The people who are attracted by spooky places will have fun time here; scaring your friends who are not as courage's as your	hotel The one thing really good here was the hot Bath tube provided big enough for you to relaxing Bath after the fun filled trip around Ooty and connor	room Connor is must visit for all the people; we felt that Connor is better place to roam around and enjoy in the cold climate than in Ooty	location The hilly mountains and cloudy sky adds to the beauty of the place	location While staying in the hotel people should bring their own shampoo; tooth brush; tooth paste and mouth wash; as are provided by the hotel	facilityEven we are just provided with one shower cap; when two people are staying together	facilityOverall though the hotel look spooky its a comfortable stay and the food provided in the hotel is also manageable	foodSo; I will definitely ask to give it a try if have or plan to take vehicles to travel around Ooty	locationGreat stay with well furnished room 	roomIt was a great time at the hotel	hotelWe requested for an early check-in; it was approved; we request for a late check-out; it was approved also; even on a off season time; some hotel would not have approved it	checkinThe reception personnel were very helpful in advise on what to do in the city	staffThe room was so good; well furnished; cool light settings great view from the restaurant and a good location	roomBreakfast was good; with fresh fruits juice; fried eggs; sliced bread and everything you would want for breakfast	foodSo I would love to spent some more days in the future at the same	hotelPleasant stay in a best budget hotel 	hotelThis is the best budget hotel in Ooty and they provide really good service	hotelThe location and view from the hotel is amazing	locationThey have a beautiful gardens where you can click good pictures	appearanceThey provide complimentary breakfast to their customers and it was really awesome	appearanceI recommend other travellers to visit this hotel :-)	hotel
