            "Excellent budget stay"/n

                    My wife rarely appreciate thing, and the hotel is one of them :) Location is the best part of the hotel its located on a pedestrian or walking street along the Lake side Which gives an excellent view of the lake. Even thou we dint have any prior booking when we reached we dint feel the pinch because the reservation process was so smooth and quick at the reception.

The reception personnel were very helpful and provided an advise on what to do in the city. Breakfast were good, will fresh fruits and juices, fried eggs, sliced salmons and everything you would want for breakfast.

            "My family planned for a vacation to Ooty and I was..."/n

                    My family planned for a vacation to Ooty and I was informed two days before the travel. It was a clear mess from my dads side as he had invited hsi brothers and they were unsure if they can make it. Regardless of all situations I had to book a stay in ooty and I called a travel agent. All I got to know is all places are booked and he can\'t assure me anything with such short notice. I did have a good experience at darshan in 2003 which made me to call them directly. I did call them and told the situation, All I heard from them was just confirm the number of people we\'ll take care and they did tell me that at the hotel it is full. I was doubtfull this time I could do something for my folks:-( Once I got to know that my dad\'s brothers are joining which made the travel complex and difficult to get a decent place. I called darshan back and informed we\'re 14, they offered an serviced appartment about 300 mts from the Hotel. I accepted and all my journey I was thinking it might not be as good as darshan is. Once I did get to the place, I was happy to see a nice furnished place with good beds. Overall it was very pleasing.

            "I am a regular customer of this Hotel and Ooty is..."/n

                    I am a regular customer of this Hotel and Ooty is my favourite hill station in south India. I have visited Ooty during every season. The most enjoying moments of my visit to Ooty is the journey from Bangalore to Ooty. The Drive amongst the green fileds on either side of the road, the wild stretch of Bandipur Forest and Madumalai with the surprise apperanace of animals like elephants, deer, Bisons, Langurs etc is a treat to the eyes and soul. I have always been lucky to see elephant everytime i have visited Ooty.
