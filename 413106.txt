            "Excellent stay,close to nature"/n
My stay at united-21 paradise, Ooty was just amazing. The location is just perfect to relax in nature's lap. Even if you have no plans for outing for one single day you can just spend the entire day here at this beautiful place as these people offer activities inside hotel like: 1. Nearby village walk 2. Trek in the (their privately owned) tea gardens 3. Born fire (if in group you can request). The hotel is in the middle of tea gardens so feel and stay has amazing experience. Their chef is awesome person, cooks really yummy food. Staff is also warm and friendly. Its in the woodbrook region very near to pykara so you can visit pykara falls and pykara lake; other places like Ooty city, Ooty lake, parks and gardens, are 25-30 kms from here still overall a perfect stay. Love the place and would definitely recommend it to others.

            "Hill view was visible from the room"/n

                    I felt good there. I did not have any difficulty to find out that hotel. Location of the hotel was excellent. Staff behaviour was good. They behaved professionally. Interior and exterior of the hotel was nice. Room was spacious with all amenities like AC, TV, etc. were working properly. There was a hill view available. There was cottage like room. Food quality was good but it was bit costly. Both veg and non-veg food was there. Activity was not there. Only Cottages were there. Parking space provided by them. Water problem, power cut problem, and all were not available there. Check-in and check-out was done on time.  They did not arrange any sightseeing trip. I went there with my friends. Money wise, it was good.

            "Respectful staff; good food."/n

                    I stayed in this hotel for 4 Days and 3 nights. The first thing impressed me is whatever I read about this hotel and what I saw there were exactly the same (Which is normally not the case). These guys dont over advertise them but whatever they say is actually there.

The staffs over here in the hotel are very respectful. They speak very fluent Hindi, English and Tamil and maybe other languages also. They are very polite and they are ready to help you at any time. Room service, Housekeeping staff all were very responsive and very courteous.

Restaurant serves you food, which is good which tastes like home made food. Not too flashy stuff on the menu but whatever they serve is good and very reasonable priced.

Come to the location, it is 4 kms from a place called Naduvattam and it is very easily located. It is situated in middle of an amazing mountain ranges and the greenery here is abundant. For people who want to see yester years Ooty should stay here. 

Rooms and restrooms are very clean. Probably the bed could have been little bigger but still manageable. The viewpoint in the "Crystal Cottage" is amazing. Hot water was not at all a problem, and good power backup and parking.

Overall, I strongly recommend this place.

            "An excellent resort for nature lovers"/n

                    We visited Ooty in Oct 2013 and stayed in this resort. It is located a little far from the main Ooty city but is very good for people who want to relax. They have their own trekking point which leads to the tea gardens which are very lovely. The cottages are very good, clean and well-maintained. Our room window give us a beautiful view of the valley. The front desk staff is very helpful. The is food very good and the room service is excellent. We enjoyed the resort so much that we stayed in the resort and extended our stay and went on a city tour after checking-out. It is such a place that if one stays there they will wish to stay again. It is a lovely resort with excellent location and very good services.
