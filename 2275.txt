            "Relaxation a top hill"/n

                    Huge Resort on top of a hill, with close proximity to the Lake and the shopping center. Large area covered with lawns, the cottages overlooking the mountain range is breathtaking. The staff is very helpful & courteous. Lot of activities both indoor and outdoor, a treat for the kids and elders alike. Food too is nice. Being affiliated to RCI, need to have a super store which is missing, otherwise a fantastic place for a vacation.

            "The hotel is currently under renovation "/n

                    5 of us had planned to drive down to Ooty from Bangalore for an extended weekend. I did some research and booked 2 superior rooms at Ooty Fern Hill - A Sterling Holiday Resort. Since it was an off season, we raked in on discounts, but when I saw the hotel and its rooms, I felt it would even be worth paying the full retail rate.
The hotel is currently under renovation and most of it is completed except the cottages. The rooms were thus new with all new amenities. Exactly as shown in the pictures. Full of amenities, bath essentials, spring queen sized bed, which was large enough to fit 3 of us comfortably, so much that we didn\'t even use the extra mattress that we booked. Wooden floors with room warmer, Safe, refrigerator and coffee maker too.
The bathroom was luxurious with glass cubicles and a RAIN SHOWER!!
The complimentary Breakfast was truly lavish, Continental, South and North Indian, Live counters and same as any breakfast buffet I have had in any 5 Star. 
Generally Ooty is an expensive place so the a-la-carte was bound to be pricey. We did not opt for buffet dinner as no one wished to stuff themselves and it was priced at Rs 575 per head which we felt wasn\'t really worth it. Sterling member\'s are given discounts on food but not just any in-house guests.
We started and finished off with main course only and a satisfying meal for 5 adults cost Rs. 1500. 
This place had an in-house SPA which was a little pricey and some indoor games and recreational activities. Nothing was included as part of my room package. So I paid extra for a robotic foot massage which felt heaven after a tiring day full of hill climbing!!
The only drawback of this place was the location which is far off from the city and the thin roads leading to it can give shocks to the weak hearted. Since we had our own car, it made our life easy, but its not advisable for people looking to use public transport for their outings. Choose a hotel closer to the bustling parts of Ooty.
Views from the room were scenic and quiet.
Staff was extremely courteous.
Loved my stay there!!

            "Great stay and extremely helpful staff"/n

                    We went by this spot in end of June. It was truly incredible. This resort is on slope top. You can have sublime perspective of nature and in addition Ooty. The settlement was exceptionally agreeable. Administrations was great. Because of downpour, yes radios were not living up to expectations but rather they gave portable numbers of every office. Housekeeping staff and administrations were great. Exceptionally, Lady Paromita was extremely helpful. Very excellent. Carrot and tea manors can be noticeable from the slope best alongside exceptionally excellent grand magnificence. It is a major property and having adequate number of rooms/lofts. For a greater family, loft convenience is fitting. From the inn, you can cover all the touring places in a day. The property is having a decent garden, loaded with blooms, get-together live with diversions, parlour and so forth.

My family was truly inspired by liberality of gathering staff. Mr. Samrat was extremely kind and supportive. Mr. Gopal too was extremely unassuming. I preferred their appreciated beverage, Yummy lemon tea.

General entire staff and office was great. Gentlemen, once you ought to appreciate this spot with superb accommodation of its kin.
