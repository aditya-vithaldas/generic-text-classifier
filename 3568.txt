            "Very good and maintained well"/n
The rooms at this place are very good and maintained well. The lawns are excellent and maintained well as well. Good place to stay when spending time at Ooty as it is easily accessible from the train and bus stations. Food is good, excellent choices for the breakfast buffet. Room service needs a lot of improvement and staff courtesy also needs improvement. Overall enjoyed the stay here and definitely recommended to others.

            "Good stay with nice rooms "/n
This is a gorgeous property which makes you feel at peace. The availability of ample sunlight during the day to keep you warm and the wood fire place in the room to keep you cosy at night adds delight to your stay. What we enjoyed was the huge space, wherein your room had a separate sitting/dining room, a separate bedroom and a wardrobe area accompanying the washroom. It was a lavish stay and would love to visit the place again with a stay at the same hotel.

            "Convenient to city with excellent stay in the hotel "/n
I went over there with my family for relaxation in the month of June. I did not find any issues in locating the hotel as it was convenient to city. There was no delay in check in and checkout process. The interior and exterior of the hotel was nice. The room allotted to me was good and it was well maintained with all required amenities in working condition including hot water facility. There was a good view from the room. The service of the staffs in the hotel was approachable and helpful. There were no activities available by the hotel. The purpose was good and the stay at hotel was value for money. I will recommend this hotel to other travellers.

            "Best place to stay in Ooty"/n

                    I visited Kluney Manor for the sole purpose of rest and relaxation. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the place was very close to the town and yet secluded thanks to the location. The building itself looks and feels like its from another era. The place is breathtakingly beautiful and the architecture is masterfully done. The staff is as courteous and approachable as can be. There rooms were so beautifully constructed that I felt like sitting and appreciating the aesthetics for the whole day. They have the entire range of cuisines anyone can ask for and although I didn't stay long enough to try all there was to offer I was very impressed with mastery of the cooks. I never felt the need to eat anywhere else. If you are looking for cozy, courteous, gorgeous and breathtakingly beautiful place to take a holiday with amazing culinary offerings and courteous staff look no further.

            "Ooty, once the reigning queen of the hills, has al..."/n

                    Ooty, once the reigning queen of the hills, has almost lost its charm, no thanks to the large scale and unplanned construction that has turned it into a concrete jungle. Yet, there are certain times of the year, like when the rest of the plains are sweltering in the summer months, that this old hill station holds a distinct charm with its warm, sunny days, flowers in bloom and chill evenings.

Our choice for accommodation this Easter break was the Kluney Manor, which calls itself a Victorian resort. As our car turned up the steep incline towards the entrance gate and turned into the portico, it did indeed seem like we had been transported back to a Victorian era. The elegant bungalow, which houses the reception and the suite rooms, is reminiscent of the days of the Raj. Add to this the sprawling lawns and the wonderful view of the Ooty Lake far below, gives it the appearance of being the perfect getaway in Ooty.

However, all is not as rosy as it seems. The website mentions that Kluney Manor was built in the mid 1800s by Capt. MacPherson of the British army as his home in the hills. Later it became the summer retreat of the Maharaja of Patna. The heydays of this manor house have obviously passed. 

The refurbishments in the dining area, for example done carelessly in new wood, take away the old world charm of this resort. There is an old piano in the parlour that is obviously more a show piece than a means of recreation as it was completely out of tune. The cottage rooms are at a lower level from the main building and if you are in a one of them, beware the paper thin walls that let you overhear your neighbours or confuse you when a phone rings in the adjoining room waking you from your slumber.

If you are looking for heritage, then a hotel like King’s Cliff would be a better bet. Of course the room rents are higher there, but it is well worth the authenticity and the excellent restaurant.

Mind you, Kluney Manor, with its rooms priced at Rs.2500 for the cottage rooms and Rs.3500 for the suite rooms (wooden flooring and bath tubs for the extra grand) is not a bad bet. The restaurant, although not a patch on Earl’s Secret in King’s Cliff, is quite good and popular with the neighbouring home stays and hotels. A tip – stick to the Indian options on the menu as the continental and Chinese are disappointing! The best item of the menu is French fries, perfectly golden brown and crisp, made from fresh potatoes.

The view of the lake, the lovely garden with summer flowers in bloom, make it charming enough, but somewhere along the line it falls just short of the mark, both in terms of quality of rooms as well as service - the latter, mainly due to the hotel being grossly understaffed despite the high season. 

All in all, this is not really good value for money if you compare it with superior heritage options. But, if you are looking for a quiet place with clean, reasonably priced rooms, good view, close enough to the centre of the town and yet far from the noise, then this is a good bet.

            "Nice hotel with average food "/n

                    This hotel is 15 kilometre away from the main Bus Stand and Railway Station. It is a Victorian style Resort at located at mountain pleasant in Ooty. The hotel ambience was great. The lawn was maintained very well. This hotel food was very delicious in taste and it had many types of food. We stayed at the Deluxe Cottage and the room were big and comfortable and hot water facility provided. This hotel was in my budget. I stayed here for three days.

                    It was a relaxing 2 day get away. The hotel had very well maintained lawns and gardens where my 2 kids spent most of time running behind birds. Ooty\'s popular attractions were all very crowded and dirty, so we spent most of time in the hotel itself. The resort was very close to ooty busstand and lake (just a km) but still felt tucked away in remote valley.  We stayed in the vintage suit. The room was big and vintage style but felt it was over priced especially in the season time. Even though there was a fireplace in room, was asked for additional 100rs for lighting it, but a room heater was provided for free. For the price of the room, fireplace lighting should have been complementary. Check-in/Check-out was quick and hassle free.
