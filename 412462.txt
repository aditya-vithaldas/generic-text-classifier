            "Perfect location & great place to relax"/n
Perfect location to relax. About 15 kms away from crowded Ooty town, it is a great place to relax. The hotel location is beautiful. Even though reaching there is a little confusing if you are not travelling in your own vehicle. The hospitality of the staff was really appreciated. The food was great and rooms were well-maintained and clean.

The view from the lawn is really beautiful. You can sit there with a cup of tea in the morning and enjoy a perfect view of the hills. Overall, I would rate the hotel 4 out of 5.

            "Excellent with beautiful rooms and tasty food "/n
I wanted a relaxing holiday with my family and opted for this place. Am glad we made the choice as the Mystic ville is a nature lover's paradise! Nestled in the lap of nature the place is quiet and romantic. Beautiful rooms, tasty food and friendly staff made our stay very pleasant. We took the vintage rooms which overlook the valley. Heritage rooms are inside so opt for the vintage if you want to enjoy nature.

            "Awesome place to stay"/n
Miles away from Ooty. Started from Hyderabad Deccan to a popular place called Ooty, without knowing whats in store for us. But seems like Ooty never seized to amaze anyone.

Although there were a couple of folks who have already been to Ooty, but this time around the experience was refreshing for everyone, apart from the jungle safaris, romantic boating, amazing scenic views, refreshing tea factories.

What made the difference was our stay. We stayed in two separate hotels of Klune for 5 days

Mistyke villa

This has beauty of its own, amidst tea gardens, away from the city. We felt amazingly astonished spending our two days and nights here. This place is just picture perfect and the hospitality and food was just right up there.

            "The most horrible experience ever"/n
After about 7 hours on the road me with our infant (1year), child (7 year) & husband arrived to Mystique Ville, totally exhausted. When we arrived, we were taken to our room directly.

The first disappointment was the horrible smell coming from the bathroom. While the receptionist was explaining about the hotel to us he also informed us there will be hot water running only from morning 6:30 till 09:30 and again evening 7:00 till 9:00. Everywhere else I had travelled the hot water was a basic service given at all times by the hotels! We ordered for lunch and was waiting when it started raining heavily. The roof started leaking directly on to our bed and also in different places. In less than 20 minute timespan the bed was soaked by the rain and there was a puddle on the floor of the room! I tried to call the reception from the hotel phone and that too was not working! I was so upset!! I called the reception from my mobile and it took them a lot of time to come and enquire why i called for them! They told me that when the rain stopped it will be ok! Really not the answer I was looking for! I informed them that I will not stay in a room which is leaking and asked them to predict the time the rain will stop which they had no answer! The receptionist told me that the manager informed him they could change the room if i can pay extra to the mountain view rooms. I disagreed because It was their fault not to check on the room condition before our arrival! 

After a heated conversation they agreed to change us for the night free of charge, conditions were that we had to change back to the same room as the mountain view. Rooms were fully booked starting the next day. We agreed and it took them exactly 45 minutes to change our room! When we changed to the mountain view room it was more disappointment because that rooms was also leaking. Luckily not on the bed! So we spent the night in that room. I liked the view from the room! But sadly that was not enough for me to relax in a hotel! When the time came as mentioned for hot water, I tried to take a bath. But there was no hot water at all! There and then I decided I will not stay in the hotel for my entire stay. I booked another hotel and checked out by 12 noon! This is by far the worst experience! 

So totally disappointed that I had to waste two days out of my 4 day vacation!

            "Food was tasty and awesome rooms"/n
Visited mystique Ville on an extended weekend after hearing so much about it. Made a reservation online just the night before and was very lucky to get a confirmation. Located at the 15th hairpin between Ooty and masinagudi overlooking the valley with a beautiful waterfall. A nice place to be for a weekend getaway. Few indoor games available to keep you occupied. A fireplace in our room was a nice touch. The food was average, but no complaints. The rooms overlooking the valley and the waterfall is a must to enjoy the beautiful place. The only disappointment was the infinity pool was under maintenance (and has been for a long time as per some of my friends who visited few months earlier). Would have loved to take a dip in the precariously located at the edge with an amazing view. Overall loved the place. Will visit again. Hope I can take dip in the pool the next time.

            "Ideally located amidst greenery!"/n

                    Stayed for a couple of nights at the resort. Found few things very nice about it. Firstly it's located far away from the crowded town of Ooty and right amidst the greenery of the Ghats. So if you are looking to get away from the maddening crowds this is ideally located. The breakfast is quite filling and is part of the package.

I drove to the place so we had only lunch at the resort and used to drive to Ooty for dinner. They can also arrange for a jeep to go to Ooty and back. Special mention has to be made about Bala, who is the guide who took us on a trek in forests around the resort. came across a sambar deer and a herd of gaurs while walking there. Very nice and scenic place altogether.

            "Perfect location,great ambiance & Value for money."/n

                    Travel is nothing new to my husband and me but this one was of course an outstanding tour. On our bike from Bangalore to Ooty, Couple of our friends & the icing on the cake - our stay at one of the best places " Kluney manor, Mystique Hotel" Waowwwwww. Located in Kalahatty, Mystique Ville is truly beautiful. The place is a heaven on earth outside the city of Ooty with no noise and pollution. A calm peacful stay. Away from the hustle bustle of the city, exactly the kind of stay you'd prefer when you're in the Nilgiris. Rooms are palatial with grand drapes, chandeliers, huge fire places, haunting paintings of British royalties and plush lawns and sit outs. The luxurious Victorian resort had elegance in itself, with the rooms being designed in the Victorian fashion. Awesome cleanliness. The sense of warmth, the early morning sunrise, the panoramic view, the little waterfall outside our window made it the most peaceful and serene stay. Excellent services. We had asked for a bonfire at 7.00 PM, hats off to the punctuality of these guys. Perfect location, great ambiance, superb food and total value for my money. Staff are awesome, they always greet you with a smile, the most importantly food is great! If you are of the kind who loves silence and wants to be in nature - and do not mind missing some pampering with service - this is *THE* place for you! I would seriously recommend this resort. I highly recommend this place for people traveling to Ooty guaranteed complete peace of mind.

            "A romantic stay in the lap of nature  "/n

                    The Mystic Villa, located 13 km from Ooty town centre, is a must stay for the  ones who love romancing with nature.

With a panoramic view of the Kalhatty waterfalls amidst the verdurous Nilgiri hills, the place is a paradise for the nature lovers.

The rooms with their vintage charm will transport you to the Victorian era.
The restaurant with its open glass view of the surrounding hills makes dining a luxury.

The cottages with clambering floral vines on the walls, the private orchard of the hotel with myriad flowering trees and the swimming pool overlooking the hills makes the entire property look quaint and beautiful.

Words cannot describe the quaint beauty of the place till you actually stay there. If you love nature and are looking for a very peaceful holiday, Mystic Villa is a must stay for you then.
