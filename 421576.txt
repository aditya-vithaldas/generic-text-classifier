            "Wonderful stay with mesmerising view"/n

                    It was a very nice stay .Our suite was very good and spacious.The beds were very comfortable.TVs were in all three rooms and in the living area.Also in one of the rooms in our suite,there was a lovely swing overlooking the lush green lawn.The view from the veranda was mesmerising with all the eucalyptus trees bordering the landscape.the garden of this resort was pretty.There was also a very cute pug who was the centre of attraction for the children.The staff was very courteous and friendly.The food was also tasty and a delicious barbecue was arranged at short notice.
Overall a wonderful and memorable stay.
Would recommend to everyone who visits Ooty .However,when in groups of more than 4/5 would advise to refrain from taking night safari through this hotel as there is lack of coordination between drivers.

            "Rooms are spacious and clean but you will have less options if you are a vegetarian! "/n

                    It was an awesome experience to be at Mount n mist. The Hotel location is very nice. Its located 12kms outside city and has great natural surroundings. The hotel facilities are good. Rooms are spacious and clean. We had booked one deluxe room which is the cheapest room available. If you want to spend more then go for luxury rooms.Rooms service is available till night 11:00 PM.  One drawback i felt was when it comes to food,You will find less options here.As a vegetarian,i was relying on only veg sandwitch and noodles. Infact that doesnot matter much as you wont be staying in hotel room all day long if you are on vacation and you will find plenty of things to eat in city. Moreover, my ovarall experience in hotel was very nice and lush green surrounding makes you feel as you are in heaven.

            "Pleasant stay & friendly environment"/n

                    From room service person, chef to manager all were attentive. They grab every chance to serve you better. Friendly environment. View from just outside the room is awesome in morning and even more beautiful in evening. If you are visiting Ooty, it's the best hotel to stay. I recommend my friends to stay in MNM whenever, they visit Ooty. Thank you so much for all the facilities and services. I will visit again in future.

            "An excellent place to stay and surely recommended"/n

                    I have been there recently in Nov'14. The experience I had is amazing. I got to know about this place through online websites. I have booked the rooms through online. When reached hotel we had slight misunderstanding in the type of room booked, but the management sort it out. The breakfast is excellent and tasty, but other items apart from rotis and curries I feel they need to improve in that. They suggested few places to roam in and around Ooty, and it made me really happy with those places. We were fortunate enough to see a tiger in the Avalanche, suggested by the management. Overall I am very happy with the stay of 2 days and 3 nights in this hotel. I would surely recommend this place.
