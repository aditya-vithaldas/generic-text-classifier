            "Rejuvenating at Ooty "/n

                    This was my first visit to Ooty, so was not knowing much about the hotels and places over there. We had booked room in Sterling hotel. We checked in at 4 pm. Front office were very friendly and fast. They spoke to us politely. They gave us room key, one of staff member moved our luggage to our rooms. He briefed us about things at room. Room was spacious, had very good balcony, had TV, had heater, had a clean shower room and toilets. Furniture in the room were also good.

We all got refreshed and headed towards dining area for early dinner as we were hungry very early. It's a buffet system. Dinner was good we had lot of options. I had Biryani and chicken curry which was tasty. And then we walked around for a while. Crowd was not much, very few people. We went to dance floor, had nice fun over there.

Then we came back to our rooms had a nice sleep. There was no disturbance of any kind of sound. We used the heater and it was awesome. We slept well. Early Morning we had a walk. There are a lot of activities happening over there every day to day. We played badminton for a while. We had tea and coffee and then followed up with complimentary breakfast. It was buffet but also had a live counter. We had nice dosas.

We roamed around the city. Relaxed well and in the evening we came back, got freshen up and checked out. Overall, the stay at the hotel was for less duration but felt nice ambiance.

            "Super cool holiday"/n

                    As I got 4 days holiday last weekend, it was planned to go Ooty with family. Reservation was made by contacting Sterling holidays customer care. I requested for 2 bedroom apartment. Unfortunately it was not available. Hence reserved two nos single room apartments for us. Us were five, viz, me, my wife, father, mother and our lovely 7 month daughter. We reached Ooty by evening four o clock on Thursday. We contacted hotel front office to get directions. The response was good and routes were explained to us. On the way we could do find direction boards at all major spots. It was top of a hill. We received warm welcome on arrival. There was staff to carry our luggage. Front office staff helped us by providing 2 bedroom apartment as it was available. The apartment was very nice. Entry was to a hall with open kitchen. Oven, mini fridge and kettles were there. The hall had a big sofa and a wall mount LEd tv with dth connection. All language channels were available. Two bedrooms were on either sides of the hall. These rooms were beautiful with comfortable bedding blankets pillows etc. It had large windows to view scenic Ooty. It also had separate tv, room heater and fridge. Bathrooms were very spacious and modern, but without a Bath tub. Overall the rooms and stay were very comfortable.

            "24 hours hot water facility, well maintained rooms"/n

                    Excellent location, there was no difficult to find out and hotel appearance, exterior and interior were very beautiful. Room was spacious with eye-catching interior and furniture was too good, neat and well maintained with good working basic amenities and there was a mountain view from the room and 24 hours hot water facility. Staff were good, polite, professional, very caring and very good service. No problem while check-in and check-out and there were activities like kids' room and play room for children. I had food with buffet, which was I stayed and the food was very good. There was sufficient parking space facility. I stayed here for 3 days with family for relaxation. It's worth to pay for this hotel room cost; it is recommendable to other travellers.

            "Excellent resort with clean rooms"/n

                    We visited Elk Hill last month and it was a wonderful experience right from the main gate of the resort both sides of the road was full of flowers, as soon as you enter the reception its just wonderful with a old charm look although some renovation work is going on but they wonderfully camouflaged it so that it will not effect the incoming guest. Room was neat and they even had fruit basket and cookies in the room all the refrigerator was empty, food was also very good only one thing which I feel to improve is their room service which is a bit slow although they are informing that the order may take 45 min.  In sort our stay in Elk hill was just wonderful and next time if we think of Ooty then definitely it will be ELK HILL.

            "It was a pleasant stay "/n

                    I was happened to be travel to Ooty with my family and international guest. We actually booked for one day. However we desire to extend one more day to enjoy the beauty at right place. Except the food part. Rest of all is worth for money! Hotel will give more discount than booking via online. It is located at main area and all major tourist attraction about 5 to 10 km.
