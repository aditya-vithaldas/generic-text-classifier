I cant wait to go here !! Its more like a home now! The morning sunrises are the best. The view is incomparable. The cottages have the best views. Food is made to order, and one needs to inform way in advance, but its very good. One needs a cab or car to go around or needs to walk up to the end of the road to take a bus to go to Ooty. They have a small games area, with table tennis and other board games. Camp fire can be arranged at an extra cost, if the resort is running full, then it happen for free !! Its very neat clean, place with very accommodative staff. The view is unbeatable.

            "Good quality room and food cost is high "/n
Stayed at Hill Country Lovedale for a night, the location and quality of room was good. Initially had feeling that cost of food is too much however when they served it we could realise. This place is strategically located where you can view 180 degree of the valley. Stay there only if you wanna spend quality time with your loved ones otherwise you won't do justice to the cost you paid.

Visited in the month of February 14th to 16th 2015. Quiet and relaxing because not many tourists around the time. Beds were comfortable and linen relatively clean. Both room was clean with modern amenities and basic toiletries. Front office is not worth mentioning. A small office right beside security. Place is away from town no local transport one needs to have their own logistics. Meaning own vehicle. Restaurant is manageable with limited menu. Resort is in an elevated place nice view of valley. Nice place to relax with lush green, fresh air with quiet place. Just a kilometer from lovedale railway station one can get to ride on narrow gauge British era train. Overall nice experience.

            "A calm & comfortable stay; recommendable one"/n
We stayed here for 02 days in the month of February-2015. A great destination located 3 km from city but well connected. Away from the hustle bustle of the city. The hotel is situated on the hill that provides amazing scenic beauty around. Our check-in was very fast. On arrival greeted nicely by manager. The rooms allotted to us was excellent with all the amenities and most important cleanness and hygiene. Food quality is awesome here. In the evening camp fire is also. Organised. The negative part of our stay was slow wifi, very poor room service which needs to be improved. But with greenery around our stay was comfortable enjoyed it. Recommend this property.

Its a very acceptable location, anchored abroad from the hustle and abstraction Ooty, the drive from Ooty to this abode is alarming with tea acreage on the way and lot of greenery around. This abode is on the acropolis top from area the accomplished basin can be beheld and it's a barbecue to our eyes during backward black and aboriginal morning. We enjoyed the arctic black with the balmy campfire, which was provided as a adulatory by the resort. Rooms are apple-pie with amazing acreage aspect about and its account blockage here. Breakfast was good, they even accommodate a beasts and sachets of sugar, coffee and tea accoutrements in the room. Overall this abode has become my admired atom for me and my wife in Ooty.

            "A nice place with good breakfast"/n

                    It was a short holiday but I thoroughly enjoyed the stay. The hotel is a straight road if you are coming from Bangalore, onto Coonoor road with a few meters right where there is a direction board. Don't trust Google maps or GPS and get lost. Just head to Coonoor Road and take right when you see the board.

The rooms are reasonably good, the front desk is nice and courteous. The view from the hotel is great. The best part is the restaurant.

Advice to travellers - Only feedback was that the front desk should be a little better informed around areas. I wanted to go to Upper Bhavani and was aware that some sort of permission is required to go there. I asked the front desk and was told that no permission is required. When I reached there after a 60 km drive, I was told that a permission was needed from District Forest Officer. I had to return back.

None the less, this is wonderful hotel in Ooty.
