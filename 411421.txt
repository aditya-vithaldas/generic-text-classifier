            "Nice Place to Stay in Ooty"/n

                    This place is very near to the boat house and the lake, it takes about less than 10 mins. Also near to other places like Railway station and the centre of the city.
Hotel - It might be the first place I stayed is without any disturbance, the ambience was great as the place is built on a small hill like place.
You will enjoy the most when you have your own vehicle as the location is a serene place. The first look of the room is amazingly clean and neat, better than expected. Couples coming for a more intimate understanding cannot escape the calmness of this place.
I liked the food, had 2 days Breakfast there and it has a mix of both south & North Indian flavours. Tea is amazing in that cold place, I had more than once with a gap of 10 mins.
Extra space for playground for adults and play area for kids is also worth visiting. You just come out of your room and can see the full range of mountains nearby (Its too cool than expected you know). I wish I had been to this place much earlier to enjoy and savour the nature ( what a lovely place to be).
As its too cool than expected, every one should bring their warm clothes and protective gear.
Service is cool, except the heater is taking a bit long to give hot water ( Yes, I understand its a very cold place on Earth). I liked the service when the facilities offered me extra hot water irrespective of your Geyser in your room.
What I recommend is to start early to cover all the places after your breakfast in the hotel. Return before its get dark and enjoy this hotel.

            "Value for money but hotel is located very far"/n

                    It was a family vacation. The hotel was located outside the city. The hotel was nearby the transportation facilities. The surroundings of the hotel were good. The appearance of the hotel was good. The staff of the hotel were helpful, friendly and cooperative with me. They were quick to attend my request. There was no delay at check-in and check-out procedure. The room provided to me was spacious, neat, clean and well-maintained. The furnishings and washroom were also good. TV, geyser and a mini fridge were provided in the room and all were functioning properly. I had stayed there only for one day. They provided hot and cold water all the time. The morning breakfast was served as complimentary. They served the breakfast in a buffet system. The quality and taste of the food was good. There were no activities in the hotel. They had only a play area over there for kids. They had some sightseeing arrangement, but we didnâ€™t avail that. They had provided a parking area. The resort was value for money. This hotel was good for vegetarian people as they serve pure veg food. They had not provided any bar over there. I would suggest them to implement a bar over there. My advice for other travellers was that as the hotel is located far from the city. They should ask the hotel people to provide pick up facility to you.

            "Mesmerising stay and decent staff "/n

                    Resort is located around the hills and away from city. Most suited place to escape from busy metro city life. Cottages are very nice with facilities like dryers, coffee makers and TV. Food is good and not very expensive. Complimentary breakfast is a plus point with variety of south Indian breakfast options. They have decent staff. Roads are pathetic to drive to reach the resort as it's around 2-3 km away from Ooty city. More suited for people with private vehicles as there are few shuttle buses to reach the resort. Should share more images on their website.

                    The location of the hotel is very convenient to reach. The appearance of the hotel on its exterior as well as its interior is very good. Basically the entire surroundings near the hotel, the view and the atmosphere are excellent. The rooms are spacious, neat clean and well maintained along with all the amenities in the rooms in proper working condition. The staffs are friendly and cooperative and give good service to the guests. The hotel provides many indoor games for the guests. The hotel provides quality food tastefully prepared. The check-in and check-out is normal. The hotel is reasonably priced and can definitely recommendable to other travellers.

            "Separate villas overlooking the valley"/n

                    We visited this place for holiday with family. The location of the hotel is though not in the main central area but is at a slightly higher altitude which gives them an advantage of space and splendid view. The hotel is spread out in a large area having separate villas giving absolute privacy.

The interiors are very good, with clean linen, upholstery and hygienic toilet. The geyser is individual but heats up the water pretty fast. The television is good, LED TV but has limited channels, most of them in Tamil. They do not have dish TV facility, but for those who want time away from the regular routine, absence of all favourite channels does not pinch.

The staff is courteous. They have a common dining area, not very lavish, but located at a strategic high location, which gives a view of the valley. The canteen staff sometimes struggles to cater to the hosts if the dining area is full. The food is good with adequate variety, but they can still improve it.

They have limited Wi-Fi ONLY IN THE RECEPTION AREA, which is a negative point. So carry your data plan. They do not have a pool, although it may not be required as the climate is so cool. They have a children playing area, with well maintained lawns. Absolutely no pollution with clear blue sky. As the location is slightly away from the main area, you need to park your vehicle always in the parking area.

Overall, a good experience. We will repeat this place on our next visit as we like solitude and hate noise.
