            "Good appearance and pleasant ambiance "/n

                    In fact we visited Ooty to select a location for organising one training program of Rotary International in March 2016. After thorough search of the available locations, facilities offered and the price demanded, we settled for this hotel and projected our requirement and arrived at a comfortable price. The hotel management was accommodative and receiving. The advantage we had was the General Manager himself was a member of local Rotary Club. Our visit was quite satisfactory for the purpose for which we visited Ooty.

The look of the hotel is good and the ambiance is pleasant. When once you enter the hotel you feel like staying there and visit again. The receiving and service and food served is good.

            "Courteous staff behaviour and fantastic rooms"/n

                    It was a new hotel and location was good. Room was very good and cost of the hotel was reasonable. It is near to the railway station. Behaviour of the staff was very good and they were very courteous. Appearance was very good from inside. It is well connected to the city but it is in very peaceful place. I like the location of the hotel. Room was very fantastic. All the amenities were there in working condition but there was no view from the room. Food quality was good and they served both food veg and non veg. Other activities were not there. There was no problem during check-in and check-out.  We went by our own vehicle for sightseeing. Facilities provided by the hotel were very good and it was more than value for money hotel. Suggestion is they should conduct some other activities and some entertainment programs for the guest and some games for kids. I would like to recommend this hotel to other travellers.
