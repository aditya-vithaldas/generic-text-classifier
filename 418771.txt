                    The hotel is at one of the best locations in Ooty. The staff is very friendly. Must mention the hotel play area has wide choice of entertainment. Its like a resort, and you can do everything in the hotel - enjoy the view food and inhouse entertainment and sporting activities.

            "Best place to spend time in the lap of nature "/n

                    This is the first time I have been to this hotel, but it was well worth the money. We booked one of the Valley View Rooms. Room was clean and tidy. They provided complimentary snacks, fruits and Tea / Coffee. They also offers complimentary Dinner and Breakfast with wide choice of dishes. Overall we had a great experience at Accord Highland with good memories.

            "The hotel is located just before the city"/n

                    The hotel is located just before the city. We arrived in the wee hours, and was slightly taken aback by the appearance. I had selected this spot for the reviews, and the scenery, but was a bit disappointed.We had indoor DJs, singalong - which was a great treat to the family. The best thing was the food - excellent taste, variety and homely - neither too spicy nor too bland. No one in our group ever had a problem. For the elderly, they had customized the group buffet to accommodate the request.Good indoor activities. As the title suggests, we had full three day to our disposal - entirely spent at the resort. From cricket, to jumping, table tennis, football, basketball and random activities for kids - it was completely engaging.The only letdown was the rooms. Monkey menace. These monkeys open the windows from the outside and get into the rooms. My niece was petrified, had a hard time getting him to stay quiet. The consistency of the hot cold water is also not there. Either too hot or just not hot.The weather does get unpredictable. When we arrived - it was pretty clear. It drizzled the next two days. Better to have an umbrella always! And carry your first aids, etc. The nearest shop / stores is 4 kms away. And a drop to the bus stand, about the same distance, would cost you a bomb of Rs.300/-.
