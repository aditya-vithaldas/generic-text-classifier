I had visited this hotel with couple. The hotel location was excellent. The check-in and check-out was done on time. There was no activity in this hotel. The sightseeing was arranged by the hotel. The food price was expensive. The room facility was well maintained. There was no delay in service. The hotel was located outside of the city. The behaviour of the staff was co-operative. I would suggest this hotel to reduce food price.

Very beautiful peaceful romantic breathe taking view the breeze killing cold wind no words to explain. From the time we booked the rooms they were on dot in all aspects. Rooms front office karaoke hall restaurant farms games camp fire all were fantastic. Worth every rupee we spend for the location. It's actually located on the edge of the cliff with a paranormal view of Avalanche. Food was excellent. We should go there for 3 nights 4 days at least to enjoy. We went in June end it was fantastic climate with drizzles and temp was down to 14 deg.

            "Excellent staff and services "/n
We visited Destiny Farmstay with family in the month of October. This place is approximately 25 km from Ooty. The last 5- 10 km of the stretch goes through the reserved forest and the terrain is rough. Vehicles are allowed only till the parking lot of the resort and the rest of the distance approx 2 km is covered in the truck provided by the resort.

The service and the staff is excellent and they take good care of the guests. Breakfast is complimentary with the stay, for lunch and dinner the guests can choose from an elaborate menu which includes Indian and Continental. Though the food is quite good the price is slightly on the higher side.

There is no internet or TV in the rooms so one can leave behind the electronic distractions and enjoy what the nature has to offer. There is a wide array of activities like joy fishing, zip lining, bullock cart rides, horse riding lessons, Treks, etc and facilities like SPA, indoor sports room, club house, etc. I would highly recommend the place for families and couples.

            "Brilliant hotel to stay"/n
Destiny Farmstay is located off Avalanche road 25km away from the Ooty. I totally loved the atmosphere the location and the experience. This hotel staff are really very helpful and polite. The entire man mountainside is there and it's very big. There was horse riding, fishing, spa and you can also go to the lake end. This hotel room was clean and well decorated. It's had a huge balcony with an amazing view. This Hotel food was very delicious in taste. We enjoyed here lot.

Location is very good, far from the crowded town. Hotel has been maintained very well. Staff are friendly and helpful. Would love to come back again. Food was of good quality but choices were limited. Best place if you want to relax and spend some peaceful time with family.

            "I booked a 3 day holiday for my family over email...."/n

                    I booked a 3 day holiday for my family over email. The replies were prompt, transactions were smooth and I got a map of the resort, as it is about 30 km away from Ooty town. On reaching there, we were told the vehicles stayed at the parking lot and the last 2km trip was made in an army one-tonner. The trip was an adventure in itself. 

Once we reached the place, there was a warm welcome & great service started right then, and stayed that way through the stay. The decor of the place is very nice, the rooms comfortable, the views spectacular. There is a lake just outside the resort\'s boundaries and is beautiful to look at. The resort is very close to the forest area but well-fenced and safe. 

The resort has a western theme that turns up in the labelling of different areas, names of rooms (like Billy the Kid, Buffalo Bill, Alain Quartermain etc. - the King\'s Cliff touch continues here)

The food was absolutely brilliant & the very civil staff is always checking to make sure the dining experience is great!! 
The supper area has a colonial aura to it and it makes for cozy dinner experiences. 
The staff is courteous to the extreme and it looks like they have customer service drilled into their heads afresh every morning. Particular mention for the very capable Anand, who manages operations with an unruffled and calm demeanour. 

The place is completely cut off from Ooty town and therefore not at all touristy. Most of the area did not support mobile phone coverage (at least, not my service provider, though BSNL had coverage) and that was a good thing. I got to relax the good old fashioned way without hearing the phone ring!

            "This Easter break, we were looking to get away fro..."/n

                    This Easter break, we were looking to get away from the city to the hills.  I remembered having been to a hidden gem called Avalanche for a camping trip during my school days and was curious to see if the place had remained pristine through the past two decades. One thing that had changed for sure is the accommodation options. I was thrilled to discover the existence of the Destiny Farmstay as I felt it would serve the dual purpose of giving the group of adults we were travelling with a chance to unwind while the children would get their first exposure to life on a farm.
The six and a half hour journey by road from Bangalore took us past Mysore, the wildlife reserves at Bandipur, Masinagudi and Mudumalai and then up the steep Segur Ghats to Ooty from where Destiny is around 22km. We parked our cars at the parking lot 2 km away from Destiny and climbed aboard an army truck as it was the only mode of transport that could take us through the bone-rattling final stretch leading to the resort. Whatever misapprehensions any of us drew about the resort from the condition of the road leading to it might have lasted ten minutes – as long as it took the truck to reach Destiny – for as we turned a corner, we were welcomed by the guards’ booth at the entrance of the resort and the picturesque scenery behind it. The Emerald Lake gleamed at the bottom of the valley despite the grey skies and the constant drizzle. The hillside was a study in contrasts with the multi-hued, geometric crop beds on one side and the wild darker greens of the natural reserve forest right beside it.
With the use of a large amount of wood and green roof tiles the resort, in spite of its 18 rooms, somehow manages to blend into the mountainside. The rooms are cosy with wooden floors and themed posters. The deluxe rooms are named after famous characters from the Wild West – Billy the Kid,  Buffalo Bill, Jesse James, Indiana Jones (to name a few) while the luxury rooms are named with a more intellectual tilt – Charles Darwin, James Herriot, Gerald Durrell. The lounge adjoining the dining area has quaintness reminiscent of a parlour from an old western with its brick fireplace, antique wrought-iron log holder by the fireside and a chandelier made from a wooden wheel.
 The room tariff includes free activities that take place at a stipulated time as per a daily schedule. Any activity out of the scheduled time or extra activities like overnight tents, rappelling, valley crossing are charged extra. The service and staff were courteous and tried their best to change the rigid schedule to accommodate our requests to reschedule activities which we missed out on due to the rain.
Destiny is a city kid’s dream come true. You could see the kids’ faces light up as they watched the geese march down from their wooden enclosure every morning before diving into the pond. They watched the rabbits and guinea pigs in an enclosure with fascination. In the cow shed they learnt about the functioning of a dairy and in the horse stables they spent time learning the names of the horses before mustering up courage to ride one around the paddock at the top of the hill. And, when the rain came down preventing any outdoor activity, they headed for the recreation room where they tried their hand at playing carom, foosball and table tennis.
As for the adults, there were many activities that had been chalked out like fishing, camping outdoors and trekking up to the nearby group property Sundance – a log cabin on top of the hill –but the rain played spoil sport. None of us complained though, we just sat back and enjoyed the light spray that the chilly winds blew on to us as we sat on the porch, admiring the calm and stillness of the mountainside over a drink and some light conversation. 
In the evening there was some respite from the rain and we all gathered around a bonfire for drinks before heading to the disco to join the kids (the conference room doubles up as a discotheque at night complete with mirrored ball, strobe lights and DJ) before heading for dinner.
The food at Destiny is all buffets and has a homely feel to it. The butter nans are simply melt-in-the-mouth and this is one place where you can indulge in them with the excuse that you need the fat content to keep warm in the cold or convincing yourself that two walks up and down the steep path to the duck pond will surely work off the calories.
The true test of a place is whether you would want to return soon for another break and in this respect, Destiny passed with flying colours. The entire group of friends we were travelling with (kids included) hoped that they could come back sometime during the coming year, hopefully to be greeted by sunny blue skies next time.
This is one farm stay that I would recommend to anyone who wants to see one of the few remaining unspoilt patches of the Nilgiris – a place so calm that sometimes the only sound you hear is silence. Probably one of the few surviving Utopian places where you can hear yourself think as you ponder over your own Destiny….

            "A superlative experience beyond words. Everything..."/n

                    A superlative experience beyond words. Everything about the resort is commendable right from the concept (coexistance of a resort with an agricultural farm) to the location (the views are spectucular) the friendly staff.
The fun starts the moment one gets on their army truck from the parking lot to the resort. The ride though bumpy gives you the feel that one is about to enter a different and more rugged world. The resort is set on a valley ledge with spectacular  views of the mountains and the backwaters of the Emrald dam. The friendly staff will guid you through the activities slotted for the day which include fishing (and I actually caught some fish), horse-riding and visit to the dairy fam. Besides this one can stroll through their fruit and vegetable farms and see how these are cultivated. One can also undertake short and long treks. For the more adventurous there are options like rapelling, valley crossing and even an overnight stay at a log house. This place is great for kids who have grown up in the urban environment as they get to see and touch domestic animals like cows, sheep, horses and even rabbits.

            "Our experience at destiny can be summed up in a si..."/n

                    Our experience at destiny can be summed up in a single word \'Perfection\'. One of the few eco-friendly resorts that exist in a world filled with seemingly sincere offerings. The staff are warm, friendly and helpful, yet value your privacy. For the adventurous types the activities are aplenty. Or if you want just relax and move into your \'nothing box\' this is the place to do it. The picturesque view is something that you will always cherish.

If you want to go to destiny you better be prepared to be unplugged from your mundane everyday world. Its best experienced without our day to day technology. The BBQ by the lake that they offer is fantastic and a must try option. If you\'re not a do it yourself kind, they will also provide you with professional help.

If you have kids, they\'ll enjoy the geese, fishing in the lake and the horse rides. They also have a full fledged dairy & other animals.

All this said, can\'t wait to go there again!!!
