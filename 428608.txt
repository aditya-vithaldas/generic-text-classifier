            "Luxurious stay at Astoria Hotel "/n

                    I have been to Ooty early 2015 to celebrate good performance of my kids in studies. The hotel does not require any endorsement from anybody. It has got everything at its best which one can expect for good time. The staff is courteous and the hotel has got good restaurant, the staff will take care to prepare food to cater to individual preferences.

            "Excellent location with nice room and its service"/n

                    It was our second trip to Ooty in the first week of 2015. We stayed in Astoria Residency for 3 nights in family suite room and experienced a home like environment. It's not a big hotel but rooms were designed in such a way that it can meet everybodyâ€™s expectation. You have different categories of rooms to choose from specific to your need. We were 3 members so decided to book for a family suite room and it was amazing, very spacious and separated as clearly shown on hotel website. Services were very good. You need not to wait a lot for any kind of service whether it is request for dinner, breakfast or warm water. Food was very good. One thing in the room which I missed was the carpet on floor. As in our room floor carpet was not there so you need to wear sleeper all time in the room. I have seen other rooms which were having carpet so I felt it would be nice if there was carpet in the room. Hotel staff were very gentle and polite, always ready to serve you. In medium budget you can have a nice room with very good service. In our third trip to Ooty I would prefer to stay again in this hotel.

            "Simple clean & budget hotel"/n

                    We came to know about this hotel from mouth of word and then we checked the reviews from holiday IQ and finally decided to stay here. This hotel is really good as people say. The hotel rooms are very clean and tidy. Parking space was ok and not too spacious, still not a problem. We reached here morning at 10 am from Chennai. And got our rooms. Since we didn't book early, we had to wait till our room got ready. But the hotel staff are real good. Even the hotel goes full all the time, they however managed to give us a room that we wanted. The staff is very quick and prompt. Food is good here. And we loved our stay at Astoria totally. Its the best budget hotel in Ooty, i guess and its maintained too well. I would definitely recommend.

            "Awesome experience with beautiful amenities "/n

                    Booked the studio suite from 13Dec to 16Dec. I was totally amazed once I saw the room. It was next to perfect. Others believe that a hotel room must give a feeling like home, but I think a hotel room should give you a feeling of amazement whenever you think about it. And that's what I feel now. Awesome double bed, home theatre system, nice and smooth lights, jacuzzi, shower and lot more also the food and room service was good. Thumbs up for guys at Astoria. Felt the need of room heater(was Chargeable, should have been complimentary at least for Studio suite) but managed once I got under the sheets.

            "Excellent room and service,Front desk is helpful"/n

                    I stayed in Astoria residency in sep. 2013. The front desk is very helpful. My check in time was 12 o'clock but I reached there in the morning they managed and gave me the room. It was really a very good experience for me. Once I got some problem I called reception the manager himself came and resolved the issue. Excellent room and service. Very good hotel whenever I will go to ooty I will stay in this hotel only.
