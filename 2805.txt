The location is walk-able distance from the Botanical Garden. It's located almost at the starting of the mall road circle in Ooty, with ample parking space. They have two restaurants also within the Hotel which are purely Vegetarian. Not sure of the food as it seemed a tad expensive for Vegetarian food so we had all our meals when in hotel just across the street there are many restaurants to choose from starting from A2B(Adyar Anand Bhavan), Sarvana Hotel and many other Non-vegetarian restaurants also.
The rooms were pretty clean with ample facilities. The TV surely needs and upgrade from the CRT ones to at least an LCD. Lifts are also available if you located on the upper floors. There is room service also, and the staff is ready to get you home cooked non-veg food if requested.

            "I stayed in a Deluxe Suite in the hotel with my wi..."/n

                    I stayed in a Deluxe Suite in the hotel with my wife and two children. The room was very neat and clean with hot water, TV and all necessary facilities. The hotel was centrally located and it was only a walkable distance to the Botanical Gardens, the beauty of Ooty. It was very easy for go for shopping as the one of the  main streets is in  front of the hotel. The hotel has two restaurants served with delicious vegetarian (Jain) food. We all enjoyed the nice time at the hotel.

            "Nahar Nilgiris is located in the center of the cit..."/n

                    Nahar Nilgiris is located in the center of the city and in the most happening market of ooty and we wanted it that way. we did not want to stay in aloof place where you cant get out after 7 p.m. The railway station is within 2 kms. The botanical garden, rose garden, boat house, charring cross market are all within 2 km of distance.
With a price tag of around INR. 2700 for room, the place is very good to stay. Rooms including the bathroom are spacious and clean, which is a big relief. The rooms have central heaters which is required in ooty at night.

Staffs are friendly except the travel desk.

considering its location and food available in house, its a good place to stay

            "The rooms are spacious and well-maintained"/n

                    It was long back, I stayed in this hotel. It was in a long distance it took 6 hours for travelling. Staff service was average and the appearance of the hotel was normal. The rooms are spacious and well-maintained with amenities like TV and geyser facility in working condition. There was a parking space available and there was no problem at check in and check out. They provided food, but there we need to purchase and give they donâ€™t provide non-veg food. There were no activities available and the booking was done through phone. It is located in the main city and the rooms had a natural view. It is value for money and recommendable to other travellers. It was a relaxation trip with my family trip and I travelled in the year November 2011.

            "Big rooms with good services, club"/n

                    We went to Ooty for a leisure trip on a bridge holiday I must say that the stay was very good. The room service was good; the staff was polite and courteous.
The Club classroom was spacious enough to make the stay memorable. The most exciting part was the pure veg restaurants. There was some problem with the parking as it was a bridge holiday and there were lot of visitors.
The hotel is located in the heart of the city and it is very close to the Botanical garden, the railway station, and the shopping center.

            "Excellent hotel and meets almost all requirements"/n

                    I visited with my family from 25 Dec. 2014 to 28 Dec. 2014 for winter holidays to a hill station and it was a wonderful place. Hotel is located in the heart of the city just adjacent to the Charing Cross. All market area are around, both attractions of Ooty, the Botanical Garden and Ooty Lake about a km away from the hotel in opposite directions. Excellent front office having a cosy look with beautiful old paintings and royal furniture in seating area. Staff are very courteous and helpful. Beds are very comfortable with neat and clean mattress and towels etc. View from our room at third floor was excellent. North Indian food was also provided and it was very good. Bathroom was nicely maintained and toiletries were provided and also tea coffee maker too. Had a pleasant stay and only thing was no indoor games or gym or swimming pool in the hotel, but these things do not come in mind when you go to hill station, because we have enough walking space and chill weather does not require swimming pool. Travel desk are also helpful. I would like to visit same hotel and same room again. I would suggest all visitors to must have a look for this hotel. Enough number of rooms with parking space available.
